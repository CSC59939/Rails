### Sign Up

**Purpose:** This page helps students and teachers signup for our service.

**How It Works:** 
1. User selects their role - either 'Student' or 'Teacher'
2. User enters their full name
3. User enters their email
4. User enters a new password for their account
5. If user chooses to signup, the [`signup`](https://github.com/CSC59939/Rails/wiki/API-Documentation#sign-up) 
API is used to create the user and set their role in the database. The user is then signed in and redirected to the dashboard.
6. If user already has an account, they can choose to signin instead.
